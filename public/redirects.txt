 The _redirects file is a crucial piece of the puzzle for deploying a React app.

Let's break it down with a simple analogy.

The Analogy: A Receptionist in a Large Office Building
Imagine your deployed website on Netlify is a large office building with only one main entrance (your index.html file). Inside this building, you have many different rooms: the "Driver" room (/driver), the "Commuter" room (/commuter), and the "Lobby" (/).

Your React Router is like a smart receptionist who sits right inside the main entrance. The receptionist's job is to look at a visitor's request (the URL) and direct them to the correct room.

The Problem: When the Receptionist is Skipped
When you first visit your site: You go to your-app.netlify.app. Netlify directs you to the main entrance (index.html). The receptionist sees you're in the lobby (/) and shows you the LandingPage. Everything works perfectly.

The broken link: Now, from the landing page, you click a link to /driver. Instead of asking the receptionist, your browser directly asks Netlify's server, "Hey, can you show me the 'Driver' entrance?"

Netlify's Confusion: Netlify looks around its building but sees only one door: the main entrance (index.html). It doesn't have a separate door called driver.html. So, it gets confused and says, "Page not found."

The Solution: The _redirects File
The _redirects file gives a simple, powerful instruction to the Netlify server. Let's look at the rule:

/* /index.html 200

/* (The "From" part): The * is a wildcard that means "for any URL path that you don't recognize..." This matches /driver, /commuter, or anything else.

/index.html (The "To" part): "...don't show a 'Not Found' error. Instead, just send the visitor to the main entrance (index.html)."

200 (The "Status" part): This is very important. It tells the browser, "Everything is okay!" and keeps the URL in the address bar as your-app.netlify.app/driver. This way, when the receptionist sees the visitor, they know exactly which room they were trying to get to.

How It Helps (The Full Flow)
With the _redirects file in place, this is what happens:

You click the link to your-app.netlify.app/driver.

Netlify's server doesn't find a driver.html file.

It checks the _redirects file and sees the rule.

It sends your browser to the main entrance (index.html) but keeps the /driver URL in the address bar.

Your React app loads, and the receptionist (React Router) sees the URL is /driver.

The receptionist then shows you the correct "Driver" room (the DriverApp component).

In short, the _redirects file ensures that every request goes through your app's main entrance, allowing your React Router to handle all the navigation correctly.
